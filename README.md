## General Information
Due to recent  announcement on Wednesday 24th August 2022 regarding student loan forginess by President Biden in America, I have gone for a student database targeted  to government, recruitment consultants and employers who will  be  willing to employ and payback a percentage of  students loan. 
This will encourage students to come forward by inputing their details. As a result, targeted end users (government, recruitment consultants and employers ) will get the best from a large pool of students( manpower) they would like to employ.
